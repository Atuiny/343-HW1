Common git commands are: status, add, commit, branch, merge. Each of these are important to using git to make most projects. status shows the stages of the files, such as if they are added to the staging area or not. the Add command puts specifice new files or changes or all new files or changes in the staging area for commit. Commit confirms the new files or changes into the repository. Branching is a way to version control your code allowing you to work with your project fully without risking your main file. Merge merges your branch with the main to take the changes done on a branch and makes them a part of the main.
